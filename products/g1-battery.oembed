LithiumTech batteries can also be charged for up to three times more cycles than a standard Ni-Cd battery. They work without memory effect, produce minimal self-discharge and weigh up to 60 percent less for all day use. Battery charge will last approximately 20 minutes, depending on usage and pressure. It takes 15 minutes to reach a 75% charge and 30 minutes to fully charge. For a longer life, the battery should be removed from the power source when fully charged.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eFeatures\/Specifications:\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eItem weight: 6.4 oz\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eProduct dimensions: 1.8” x 3.1”\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSeries: LithiumTech\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBattery style: post\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBattery type: Li-Ion\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRecharge time: 30 min.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eVoltage: 12V\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e","brand":"TheraGun","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":34116923521,"sku":"42","price":50.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1211\/9100\/products\/ONE_BATTERY_f4ed0a60-b4c1-4308-9987-bc1b0c151faf.jpg?v=1494621717","url":"https:\/\/theragun.com\/products\/g1-battery","provider":"TheraGun","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
